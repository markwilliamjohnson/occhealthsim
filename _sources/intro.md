### Large Language Model simulation of occupational health case-studies
##### Risk and Language 
According to sociological theories of risk (for example, Luhmann or Beck) Risk is a concept encoded in language. It therefore is unsurprising that Large Language Models encode the likelihood of known risks by encoding the structures of language. For example, if a LLM is prompted to generate a case-study of a worker in a bakery, it is more likely that the generated text refers to respiratory problems than cardiovascular problems. Equally, if the system is asked to generate the case-study for a diver, it is unlikely that a case would be generated featuring dermatological problems. 

**large language models are non-random reflections of the constraints represented in language** 

### Coding and analysis of collected data
LLMs can re-represent text in many different ways while preserving its meaning. This enables tools to substitute a long piece of text for a few keywords, in essence **coding** the data into categories which can be stored and analysed in a database.

### Synthetic data
Using a combination of Large Language Model techniques and statistical models, it is possible to create large-scale synthetic datasets which may either be based on real datasets, or fabricated within a specified set of constraints from scratch. Prevalence of conditions within these datasets can be tested for consistency with real data. One of the advantages of such datasets is that they may be used both in education, and in research. For research their utility can be to establish the difference between **normal** data and outliers in real data which might indicate **sentinal cases**


### Statistical analysis
LLMs, in combination with statistical tools, can provide effective solutions for data analysis...

### Virtual consultants
Large Language Models are capable of providing consultancy in occupational hygiene and occupational medicine.
